## 3.1 Introduction

<a name="3.2"></a>
## 3.2 Infrastructure Services

> This chapter shall list the services provided by the infrastructure. Some example of these services can be: log collection, monitoring, health check, load balancer. For the shake of clarity CaaS services should be also listed, like container lifecycle management or networking services.

<a name="3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Container Compute Services

> This chapter should describe considerations about container compute services.

<a name="3.2.1.1."></a>
#### 3.2.1.1 Memory management

> This chapter should describe considerations about memory management, like huge pages.

<a name="3.2.1.2"></a>
#### 3.2.1.2 HW Topology management

> This chapter should describe considerations about hardware topology management.

<a name="3.2.1.3"></a>
#### 3.2.1.3 HW Acceleration

> This chapter should describe considerations about hardware acceleration, like device management.

<a name="3.2.1.4"></a>
#### 3.2.1.4 CPU management

> This chapter should describe considerations about CPU management.

<a name="3.2.1.5"></a>
#### 3.2.1.5 Container Runtime Services

> This chapter should describe considerations about the services of container runtimes.

<a name="3.2.2"></a>
### 3.2.2 Container Networking Services

> This chapter should discuss networking related considerations of container network services, like:
> * Ingress and any limitations on protocol or raw interface support
> * Dependencies on external loadbalancers
> * Regular service mesh related considerations
> * Network Service Mesh related considerations
> * Number of interfaces and IP addresses to be supported by a pod
> * IPv6 single and dual stack needs

### 3.2.3 Container Storage Services

> This shapter should discuss storage services provided by the reference architecture. 

<a name="3.2.4"></a>
### 3.2.4 Kubernetes Application package manager

To manage complex applications consisting from several pods the reference architecture may provide support for a Kubernetes Application package manager. The package manager may be able to manage the lifecycle a set of pods and provide a framework to customize a set of parameters for the deployment.
